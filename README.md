# UR5_SMD_installer
This repository contains UR5 model for gazebo, which has vacuum gripper and OpenCV camera script for component's angle correction.
Because of vacuum gripper plugin specifics, components can't be rotated by UR5 wrist, so rotation emulated by changing component's model yaw angle by /gazebo/set_model_state service.
